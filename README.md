## Pattern Based Ransomware Classification

The paper proposes a machine learning technique to classify ransomware binaries. The classification computation time is less with the usage of the static strings of the binary as a feature. The reasons for choosing static strings as a feature are the nature across ransomware binaries,crypto-ransomware aims to encrypt files & usage of APIs are similar. Hence static strings found in the binaries have a text pattern & this textual pattern plays a major role in classification. Machine learning algorithms used in this paper are Naive Bayes Classifiers, Support Vector Machine & Keras Deep Learning Neural Network.Keywords: Application Programming Interface (API), Crypter, Packer, Support Vector Machine (SVM).
